# discord.js-starter-kit

A simple starter kit to introduce users to TypeScript, discord.js and discord.js-commando.  

# How to run
On the command line, run `tsc -p .` in the root directory of this project. That will compile all the TypeScript files to JavaScript, when you can just run `node --harmony index.js`
